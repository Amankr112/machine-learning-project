##Fake News Classification Using Random Forest:


"Fake News Classification Using Random Forest" is a machine learning-based approach designed to classify news articles as either real or fake. The main objective is to develop a reliable model that can distinguish between authentic and fabricated news using a Random Forest Classifier, a popular ensemble learning method.

### Project Overview:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    - **Datasets**: The project utilizes two datasets: one containing fake news articles and another with real news articles. The datasets are loaded from local CSV files, with each dataset containing news headlines, article text, subjects, and publication dates.
    - **Sampling**: To manage computational resources and ensure balanced class representation, the project samples 5000 instances from both the real and fake datasets.
    - **Class Labeling**: A new column named "class" is created to label the real news as `1` and the fake news as `0`.
    - **Text Concatenation**: The text data is prepared by merging the title and the main body of each article, as this combination is assumed to be more indicative of the article's nature.
    - **Feature Engineering**:
        - **Body Length**: The length of the text (excluding spaces) is calculated and stored as a new feature.
        - **Punctuation Percentage**: The percentage of punctuation characters in the text is computed, offering another distinguishing feature between real and fake news.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
    - **Text Cleaning**: The text is cleaned by removing punctuation and converting all characters to lowercase.
    - **Tokenization and Stemming**: The text is tokenized into words, and non-essential words (stopwords) are removed. Stemming is applied to reduce words to their root form, which helps in generalizing the text.

3. **Data Splitting**:
    - The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 60-40 ratio. The training set is used to train the Random Forest model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

4. **Feature Extraction**:
    - **TF-IDF Vectorization**: The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer is used to convert the text into numerical features, capturing the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset. 
    - The vectorized text data is combined with the additional features (body length and punctuation percentage) to form the final feature set for model training.

5. **Model Training**:
    - **Random Forest Classifier**: A Random Forest model is trained using 150 decision trees (`n_estimators=150`). The model is set to have no maximum depth (`max_depth=None`) and utilizes all available processors (`n_jobs=-1`) for faster computation.
    - The trained model is then used to predict labels for the testing set.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
    - **Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. 
    - **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing deeper insights into the modelâ€™s predictive performance.

7. **Visualization**:
    - **Confusion Matrix Plot**: The confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap, which clearly shows the distribution of predicted labels against true labels, helping to identify any biases or areas of improvement for the model.

### Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates the use of Random Forest for binary classification in a fake news detection context. By leveraging text processing techniques and integrating additional features like text length and punctuation usage, the model aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of the classification. The resulting metrics and confusion matrix provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses, guiding future improvements or iterations.


##Maternal Health Risk using machine learning:


maternal health risk assessment using machine learning involves the development of predictive models that leverage patient data to identify and manage risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth. These models have the potential to enhance maternal healthcare by enabling early interventions and improving overall outcomes for both mothers and infants.
The primary objective is to use machine learning to improve the quality of care provided to expectant mothers, reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and enhance the overall experience and outcomes of pregnancy and childbirth. It's crucial to ensure that the model is developed and deployed with a focus on patient privacy, ethics, and adherence to healthcare regulations.
Dataset in this model is all about the ages with their systolicBP,DiastolicBP,BS,BodyTemp,Heart rate,Risk level.
