Maternal Health Risk using machine learning:


maternal health risk assessment using machine learning involves the development of predictive models that leverage patient data to identify and manage risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth. These models have the potential to enhance maternal healthcare by enabling early interventions and improving overall outcomes for both mothers and infants.
The primary objective is to use machine learning to improve the quality of care provided to expectant mothers, reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and enhance the overall experience and outcomes of pregnancy and childbirth. It's crucial to ensure that the model is developed and deployed with a focus on patient privacy, ethics, and adherence to healthcare regulations.
Dataset in this model is all about the ages with their systolicBP,DiastolicBP,BS,BodyTemp,Heart rate,Risk level.
